              You will recognise the pose and demeanour that has made Yusuf Dikec one of the most famous faces of Paris 2024.

The Turkish shooter has gone viral for the relaxed style of competition that led him to a silver medal in the 10m air pistol mixed team event with Sevval Ilayda Tarhan.

It has even turned into a popular celebration among other athletes, especially in the athletics competition at the Stade de France.

From Sweden’s Armand Duplantis to Australia’s Nina Kennedy, even the Team GB women's relay team before their final, everyone is doing the Dikec.

            <p class="fst-italic">
              Neeraj Chopra admitted that he wasn't at his best during the Paris 2024 Olympics, as fears of aggravating an injury held him back.

Despite this, the Indian javelin ace still managed to produce one of the best throws of his career at the Games, including an 89.45m throw that earned him a silver medal.

Neeraj Chopra's bid to defend his title fell short in Paris as Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem unleashed an incredible throw of 92.97m, breaking the Olympic record, to win the gold medal.

The Indian ace’s Paris 2024 campaign proved to be a mixed bag. Although Neeraj recorded the second and third best throws of his career in the final and the qualification rounds, respectively, he was mentally unable to push himself in the final because of fears of injuring his groin again.

“I feel like I could have achieved greater distance in the final because both my throws in Paris (in qualification and in the final) were my second and third-best throws. In javelin throw, it’s possible to achieve an extra 3-4m if you get the angle of release right.

                <h3>What does an athlete have to do to participate in the Olympic Games?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>Taking part in the Olympic Games is every athlete’s dream, and requires huge amounts of determination and long years of training.

                    Athletes must first comply with the Olympic Charter and follow the rules of the International Federation (IF) governing their sport. The IFs establish the rules and organise qualifying events, while the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the athlete’s country supports the athlete and is responsible for entering them for the Games.</p>

A competitor who is a national of two or more countries at the same time may represent either one of them, as he may elect.</p>
